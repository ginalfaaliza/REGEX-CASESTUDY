# REGEX-CASESTUDY
Enhacing Text Analysis Skills with Regular Expressions (REGEX)

**Objective:**

The main objective of this project is to improve my proficiency in using Regular Expressions (REGEX) for the text analysis and pattern matching. This includes developing advanced skills in extracting, manipulating, and analyzing text-based data across various contexts, such as data cleaning, data extraction, and validation.

common syntax of REGEXP:

`SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name REGEXP argument;`

common syntax of REGEXP_LIKE:

`SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE REGEXP_LIKE(column_name, match_paramaters);`
**Scope:**
1. Pattern matching: Develop and test different REGEX patterns to identify complex data structures
2. Text Processing: Use REGEX to perform operations such as data extraction, text replacement, and data validation
3. Data cleaning: Automate text cleaning processes by removing unwanted characters, correcting formats, and normalizing data fields
